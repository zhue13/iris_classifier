# Averages of Iris Features

[Dataset: ](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)
_author_: Edward Zhu

    This program returns the averages of the features of iris flowers.
    The program is written in python, and utilizes docker images

### Features
1. Docker image with requirements.txt for the python libraries
2. script.sh file with the commands to build the image and run the container


Note: I tried to use a normal csv reader to read the data but idk where it went wrong
so in the end I decided to just read the file with numpy functions :')
